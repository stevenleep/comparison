- *Dependency Update...*
- *A version management platform for file systems*

```bash
pnpm install @stevenleep/comparison
```

## Features

## API
- [API Documents](https://branlice.github.io/version/modules.html)

  ```typescript
  import { compare } from "@stevenleep/comparison";

  const version1 = "1.0.0";
  const version2 = "2.0.0";

  const result = compare(version1, version2);
  result.isGreater; // false
  result.status; // negative
  ```
- the comparison of the version is only one of the application scenarios. Parser at the bottom only provides the ability to install specific characters split. You can expand a lot of things based on this (depending on your own interests and ideas)
